    <h1>Our history and ambitions</h1>
    <h4 class ="history">Stark Industries is a defense technology company that was founded by Howard Stark in <span>1940.</span> <br /> Already in the beginning of the history of our company, we helped
    the United States Armed Forces by providing innovative weapons. Howard's ambitions to accelerate humanity's leap towards a better future
    culminated in one of his inventions, the Arc Reactor. <br />
    During the later years of his life, sometime after his involvement in World War II, Howard Stark developed <br /> 
    the idea for an alternative power source that could provide clean energy to benefit his humanitarian views for the future of mankind. <br /> 
    <br />
    Stark saw the Arc Reactor as the stepping stone to create a new, stable element that would render nuclear power obsolete. However, Vanko saw the 
    Arc Reactor as a way to get rich and when Stark found out, he had Vanko deported to the Soviet Union. <br />
    Howard began working alongside Anton Vanko during the <span>1960s</span> and together they eventually designed the first Arc Reactor, which Howard began to 
    develop through his company, Stark Industries. <br />
    <br />
    In the years after Howard's death, the Arc Reactor project became a non-priority to the company as it was steered towards mainly producing 
    weapons, with the then acting CEO, Obadiah Stane, dismissing the clean energy project as a "publicity stunt". <br />

    A large Arc Reactor industrial energy production was created to power 
    Stark Industries' previous headquarters in Los Angeles. <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span>Milestones</span>
    <br />
    <br />  
    In <span>1974,</span> Stark designed the Stark Expo, the "City of the Future," but was unable to finish it due to limited technology.<br /> 
    Howard Stark died in 1991, leaving ownership of the company to his son Tony and placed his partner Stane as CEO. <br />
    <br />  
    In <span>1991</span> Stark Industries won the Arthur M Wellington prize (American Society of Civil Engineers) <br />
    <br />  
    Stark Industries has won a CES Innovations Award 5 times (<span>2006, 2007, 2009, 2013, 2019</span>) <br />
    <br />  
    In <span>2007</span> Stark Industries acquired Fujikawa and AccuTech. Fujikawa is a japanese company specialised in researching holography 
    and heads-up displays for various uses. 
    AccuTech, specialised in weapons and security systems, cooperated with Stark Industries to develop weapons such as the Jericho missile and the Stark Sonic Cannon. <br />
    <br />  
    In <span>2009</span> Former CEO Tony Stark conceived a groundbreaking, cutting-edge invention that would offer clean energy efficiently to the whole world;
    The Arc Reactor. Although his father Howard Stark had invented an Arc Reactor decades before, Tony Stark's Arc Reactor was astonishing
    because of its size. In the beginning, the public was not informed about the invention.
    Eventually, Tony Stark decided to continue his father's ideals to use the Arc Reactor to provide clean energy for the world. 
    In order to profit on this ideal, Tony Stark created a redesigned Industrial Arc Reactor to power the newly-built Stark Tower in Manhattan, New York. The building was
    completely removed from the city's power grid and relied entirely on the Arc Reactor in order to make Stark Tower a “beacon of clean energy” and show the world the capability of Arc Reactor technology on a large scale. 
    Even though the Arc Reactor was only a prototype, the building was capable of maintaining itself for an entire year. <br /> 
    <br />  
    In <span>2014</span> the Collier Trophy, an annual aviation award administered by the U.S. National Aeronautic Association (NAA), was awarded to Stark Industries
    for its research in Ramjet propulsion.
    The Collier Trophy is the most prestigious aviation award, annually given for the greatest achievement in aeronautics or astronautics. <br /> 
    <br />  
    In <span>2015</span> an employee at Stark Industries won the NAS Award in Aeronautical Engineering, which is an award awarded by the 
    U.S. National Academy of Sciences "for excellence in the field of aeronautical engineering." <br />

    
     <br />

    In <span>2010,</span> Stark Industries was the world's 3<sup>rd</sup> largest weapons manufacturer
    Had Tony Stark decided to continue the weapons manufacturing division, we would have remained
    at the same rank. <br />
    <br />  
    Our weapons have been showcased on the annually held Stark Expo, and they have been on active deployment in battlefields in Afghanistan and Iraq.
    While we no longer produce or sell weapons, the weapons we have created have displayed combat-capability that has been much appreciated by 
    our clients. <br /> </h4>

    <h1>The Future of Stark Industries</h1>
    <h4 class="history">"I came to realize that I have more to offer this world than just making things that blow up. And that 
    is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down the weapons manufacturing division of Stark Industries
    until such a time as I can decide what the future of the company will be."
    ―Tony Stark <br /><br />

    Maintaining the moral compass is a crucial part of our mission. Unlike many weapon conglomerates, we have chosen a different path; we don't participate in grim conflicts worldwide.<br /> Anthony "Tony" Stark witnessed that the potential of the
    company should averted from that direction and that the target of Stark Industries should instead be to become more focused on improving people's lives and the world by pushing the boundaries of today's technology. </h4>
